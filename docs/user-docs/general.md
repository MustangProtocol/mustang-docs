# General

### What is Mustang Finance?
Mustang Finance is a decentralized borrowing protocol that lets users deposit ETH, LSTs, and ARB as collateral, and mint the stablecoin MUST at an interest rate depositors choose. Mustang Finance is a friendly fork based on Liquity v2.

### The main use-cases for Mustang Finance are:

- Borrow MUST
- 1-click multiply exposure to collateral assets
- Earn yield by depositing MUST in the stability pool or farming elsewhere
- Stake NERI to direct PLI (Protocol Liquidity Incentives) and earn rewards
- Stream MUST as a subscription, salary, grant, or any other kind of payment

To understand Mustang Finance it's helpful to understand [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org) 


:::tip
**Liquity V1** was a lending protocol that allowed users to take 0% interest loans on their ETH to receive $LUSD. Over the past 4 years it proved itself resilient in a variety of market conditions.

**Liquity V2** is the next iteration of borrowing, allowing users to set their own interest rate, and use more tokens as collateral.

## Does Mustang Finance have governance?
Mustang Finance is subject to minimal governance which is solely tasked with distributing Protocol Liquidity Incentives (PIL), directing 25% of the protocol's revenue to external initiatives, delegating ARB, and updating collateral debt limits. Governance can never change the fee split, update protocol parameters, mint new stablecoins, or anything else.
