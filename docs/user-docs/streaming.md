# Streaming
Anyone can start streams with USND right now here: https://app.superfluid.org/


Nerite has the [Superfluid](https://superfluid.org/) protocol built into itâ€”-USND is a "[pure Super Token](https://docs.superfluid.org/docs/concepts/overview/super-tokens#pure-super-tokens)" that supports streaming. That means you can make real-time, ongoing USND payments. When you open a stream, USND is sent linearly over time until you edit or close the stream with another transaction. You can send $0.000001 per second for two weeks, $5 per month for a year, $100 per hour indefinitely... It's completely up to you.

USND is the first real-time stable currency.

## Create a Stream
Our full UI for this is under development. Check out the [Superfluid App](https://app.superfluid.org/) to access this feature now. 

## Receiving a Stream
You do not have to do anything to accept a stream, and your wallet balance will increase in real time when someone streams to you. No special wallets or anything else needed, as USND is a normal ERC-20 token. 

Streams are not dependent on block times or the L2 sequencer.

## Example Use Cases
Superfluid streams offer exciting new possibilities for programmable money:
- Annuities that pay out yield earned on a position linearly forever.
- Onchain subscriptions. Example: stream $25 linearly over a month to maintain access to content or services (and cancel at any point).
- Milestone-based grants. Instead of giving full grant amounts up front, stream the amount over a period of time while milestones are expected to be reached.
- Loans that pay themselves off by streaming yield from a yield-bearing collateral to pay down debt. 

Are you building one of these? Let our team know--we want to support you!

We are working on several streaming-related features and services built on top of Nerite.
